# Datepicker

A date picker is an input widget with an associated popup that enables users to
select a date from a calendar.

<Resources pkg="@zag-js/date-picker" />

<Showcase id="Combobox" />

**Features**

- Support for selecting multiple values
- Support for disabled options
- Support for custom user input values
- Support for mouse, touch, and keyboard interactions
- Keyboard support for opening the combo box list box using the arrow keys,
  including automatically focusing the first or last item accordingly

## Installation

To use the date picker machine in your project, run the following command in
your command line:

<CodeSnippet id="date-picker/installation.mdx" />

This command will install the framework agnostic date picker logic and the
reactive utilities for your framework of choice.

## Anatomy

To set up the date picker correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and
how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="combobox" />

## Usage

First, import the date picker package into your project

```jsx
import * as datepicker from "@zag-js/date-picker"
```

The date picker package exports these functions:

- `machine` â€” The state machine logic for the date picker widget.
- `connect` â€” The function that translates the machine's state to JSX attributes
  and event handlers.
- `collection` - The function that creates a collection interface from an array
  of items.

Next, import the required hooks and functions for your framework and use the
date picker machine in your project ðŸ”¥
